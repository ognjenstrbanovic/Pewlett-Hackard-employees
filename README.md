Hired at *Pewlett Hackard*, my first major task is a research project on all employees from 1980 up until 1990.  
All that remains of the database is stored in six CSV files.  
The assignment was the following: "design the tables to hold the data" (by doing some inspection and created an Entity Relationship Diagram, or ERD, in this case using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com), "import the CSVs into a SQL database" (that Relational Database Management System, or RDBMS, in which we will create a schema, will be PostgreSQL here), and "answer questions about the data by listing specific information" (this can be found in the `queries.sql` file).  
This was, in other words, **Data Modeling**, **Data Engineering**, and **Data Analysis**.  
The optional bonus that I completed was to visualize said data. Using SQLAlchemy, I imported the SQL DB into Pandas, eventually creating a histogram and bar chart, respectively:

And this was the ERD that I had created beforehand:
